            At The OG, striving to be "OG" in every aspect of our operations is

            Our journey began in March 2021, born from a vision to create a
            space that wasn't just a restaurant, but a celebration of brunch
            culture. Located in the vibrant McGregor Square, adjacent to the
            bustling energy of Coors Field, The OG has quickly become a
            cornerstone of Denver's dining scene.

            Originally conceptualized as a 1950's diner, we embraced the
            nostalgic charm of the era, serving up classic lunches and dinners
            alongside weekend brunches. While we cherished our roots, we soon
            realized the true calling of our establishment lay in the unique
            allure of brunch - a meal that symbolizes relaxation, indulgence,
            and togetherness.

            We embraced this calling wholeheartedly and transformed The OG into
            a brunch-only destination. This bold move was driven by a passion to
            innovate and a desire to serve our community better. The change was
            more than just altering our menu; it was about aligning with the
            heart and soul of our space, our people, and the vibrant energy of
            Denver.
