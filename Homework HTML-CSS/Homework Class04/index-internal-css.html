      of 60-85 cm (24-33 in) and weighs 4-15 kg (8.8-33.1 lb).

      ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern
      populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their

        ><i>Eucalyptus</i></a
      >
      woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This
      eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxic
      compounds that deter most other mammals from feeding on it. Koalas are

    <h2 class="subheading">Etymology</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The word "koala" comes from the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharug_language" target="_blank"
        >Dharug</a
      >
      <i>gula</i>, meaning 'no water'. Although the vowel "u" was originally

      as "oo" (in spellings such as <em>coola</em> or <i>koolah</i> — two
      syllables), the spelling later became "oa" and the word is now pronounced
      in three syllables, possibly in error.<a
